# database-image-task

This is an image for use in a Lagoon advanced task to create a database container image from a live database.

Currently it only supports mysql/mariadb, but could eventually be extended to support other database systems.

There are some requirements and other things that need to be called out for its usage. Some gotchas as well with variable names that may prevent multiple versions working properly that may need revisting.
